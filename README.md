# Twenty One
## A Multithreaded Java Game Project

This project was created as part of the Advanced Programming course on the University of Glasgow's MSc Software Development programme.

The goal of the project was to demonstrate an understanding of concurrency in Java as well as distributed systems, in this case a client-server system.

Further information can be found in the accompanying  documentation:

- The [task specification](Specification%20-%20Advanced%20Programming%20Project.pdf) provided by the university.
- The [design document](Design%20Document.pdf), which includes:
  - The game's aims, rules, and mechanisms.
  - Design and implementation overviews and justifications, including UML diagrams.
  - The game's application level protocol.
- JavaDoc comments throughout the code.
